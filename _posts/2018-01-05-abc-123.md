Metrics can be great tools to measure things, but like any tool, there's the right one for the job. Not only
do you need to know which one to use, you also have to wield it correctly; otherwise, you'll do more
harm than good.

Recently, I got into a discussion with a colleague of mine during a pull request review. We were
discussing the merits of readability and conciseness over a particular method. The crux of
the matter was intermediate variables versus method chaining. The pull request offered a method that
used intermediate variables and looked something like:

``` ruby
def intermediate_variables(input)
  result_a = input.map { |x| step_a(x) }
  result_b = result_a.map { |y| step_b(y) }
  result_b.uniq
end
```

``` ruby
def method_chaining(input)
  input.map { |x| step_a(x) }.map { |y| step_b(y) }.uniq
end
```

I was arguing for the one-liner because it was more concise, and my colleague was in favor of the
former approach, arguing that it was more readable. I also assumed that because the intermediate
approach had more assignments, its ABC score would be higher. Having some metrics to back me up, I thought, would
bolster my argument. Well, as it turns out, the metrics were not in my favor:

``` bash
$ flog intermediate.rb
     5.9: flog total
     5.9: flog/method average

     5.9: main#intermediate_variables      flog.rb:1-4

$ flog method_chain.rb
     6.9: flog total
     6.9: flog/method average

     6.9: main#method_chaining             method_chain.rb:1-2
```

Even if we take this to absurd proportions, the method chain approach will always score higher:

``` ruby
def intermediate_variables(input)
  result_a = method_a(input)
  result_b = result_a.method_b
  result_c = result_b.method_c
  result_d = result_c.method_d
  result_e = result_d.method_e
  result_f = result_e.method_f
  result_f.method_g
end
```

``` ruby
def method_chaining(input)
  method_a(input).method_b.method_c.method_d.method_e.method_f.method_g
end
```

``` bash
$ flog intermediate.rb
     9.2: flog total
     9.2: flog/method average

     9.2: main#intermediate_variables      intermediate.rb:1-8
$ flog method_chain.rb
    11.2: flog total
    11.2: flog/method average

    11.2: main#method_chaining             method_chain.rb:1-2
```

I found this surprising. In the end, we opted for the intermediate approach not because of the flog score
but because the actual example used `map` and other methods that did make it confusing to read. The intermediate
variables do help improve readability, and as it turns out, lower the flog score too.

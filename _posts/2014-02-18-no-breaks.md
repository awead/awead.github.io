New year, yes I know, it's late.  I've been doing lots of front-end and web design work which I readily admit is not my strong
suit.  However, I stick to using the Bootstrap framework and try to work within its defaults as much as possible.  I find
this helps force me to be consistent and maintain control over layout.

Recently I had a sort-of mini realization that the break tag isn't really that good to use. First of all, it has that
weird "no closing tag so we tack one on at the end" thing, which just bothers me. There may be instances when you have to use
a break tag or when it makes the most sense, but what I've been doing lately is asking myself, why
am I using it in the first place?

Let's say you have some plain text that you need to break up into sections:

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <br/>
    consectetur adipisicing elit, <br/>
    sed do eiusmod tempor <br/>
    incididunt ut labore <br/>
    et dolore magna aliqua. <br/>

Nothing wrong with that.  But, you might ask yourself what is it that's significant about these strings that merits
their breakage?  Maybe these are lines of a poem, or some other structure.  So why not reflect that in the code:

    <div id="first-stanza">
      <span class="line">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,</span>
      <span class="line">consectetur adipisicing elit,</span>
      <span class="line">sed do eiusmod tempor</span>
      <span class="line">incididunt ut labore</span>
      <span class="line">et dolore magna aliqua.</span>
    </div>

Then we just add a little css to take care of the line breaks:

    .line {
      display: block;
    }

Of course, you could use paragraph tags here as well.  There are a multitude of options, but my point is that if you're
reaching for that break tag a lot, chances are there's a more elegant solution that will better reflect the structure
of your document.  That has broader implications when we think about how our pages get linked to other pages and how
we want the web to make sense of them.  That's easier when we've created a clear structure to interpret.

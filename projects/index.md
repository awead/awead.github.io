### Valkyrie and Hyrax

[Benchmark Testing with Valkyrie and Hyrax](/fedora-tests) covers some in-depth analysis I did
with Valkyrie's different adapters and Hyrax. The results here were the basis for
[Performance Metrics with Valkyrie and Hyrax](/presentations/fedora-tests) which I gave a SamervaConnect
in 2017.

### CHO

[CHO Benchmark Tests](/cho-benchmarks) shows performance benchmarks for Penn State's CHO project, which
uses Valkyrie with Postgres and Solr.

### Lake Superior

[Performance Comparison with Lake Superior](/lake-superior) shows differences between
alternative Fedora API implementations such as Lake Superior.

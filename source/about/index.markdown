I'm a software developer and systems administrator.  Most of my current work is in Ruby; however, I do a host of other things too
as required.  I work for the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Musueum](http://rockhall.com),
at the [Library and Archives](http://library.rockhall.com) where I manage digital collections and support our online
[catalog](http://catalog.rockhall.com).
